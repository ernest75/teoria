Packages are part of application's architecture.

The way you package your application today determines how easy will be to read the code tomorrow and understand what it does later.

It will also affect the way you structure the dependencies in the code itself.

You should be able to tell the business domain targeted by the application just by looking at it's top-level packages.

Not only top level packages are important. All of them are.

You want to structure your code in such a way that classes which often change together sit as closely as possible in the package structure.

If there's more than 5 classes in one package it's time to look if you can reestructure your packages and crerate sub-packages.
