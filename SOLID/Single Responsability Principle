SRP : Each class in a system should have only one responsbility

More elavorated definition :

SRP : You should be able to describe what each calss does without saying "and"

Better definition :

Srp : Each class should have only one reason to change

Srp violations lead to excessive coupling, When several responsabillities get mixed it's very difivult to ensure that changes to one of them won't affect other responsibilities 

Final State Machine (FSM) = Component that handles inputs, produces outputs and has internal state

Break functionalities into smaller classes even if you're sure that no modifications will be required

Small, focused and easy to inter-connect classes open more options you will have in your aplcation's design and you cccan always refactor to a diferent structure

SRP is the most important principle in object-oriented design
