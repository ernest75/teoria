Unit: Container of functionality that has specific responsability and clearly defined boundary. Most commonly a class in java.

Testing : Ensure that the "thing" does what it's supposed to do.

Unit testing : Ensuring that a class does what it's supposed to do

You apply prededined inputs to units and make sure that they produce the expected output.

Junit : unit testing framework for Java

@Before : tells JUNit that this method must be run before each single test case. It's runed once, not before each single text

Naming of the unit tests:

	- When properly named unit test fails, you can investigate and fix the issue without reading unrelated code

	- General guidelines for method names do not apply


Unit test name patern:

	<unitOfWork_<stateUnderTest>-<expectedBaehavior>

	UnitOfWork can be defined as the "functionality element of a Unit" Ex StringDuplicator unitOfWork = duplicator +o-
	StateUnderTest = "conditions parameters of the test" if u are testing when and int is positive xxxxx_intaIsPOsitive_returnxxx
	Expected behaviour = result ex return true


Nullability: 

	- Method arguments and return values are non-null by default

	- Nullable values will be explicity annotated with @Nullable

	- No need to test null in most cases

	- Requires discipline and sanitization of input data


Boundary conditions are very common sources of bugs.

How to chose test cases: 

	- 100% line coverage is necessary , but not sufficient to ensure good coverage of SUT functionality.

	- Identify different groups of input combinations corresponding to different states

	- Write at least one test case for representative of each group

	- Write test case for boundary conditions between differnet groups of inputs


Sumarize section:

	- Unit tests ensure that the system under test (unit) behaves according to the requirements

	- Unit tests names should provide all the information required for failure investigation and debug

	- Treat all arguments and return values as non-nullable unless annotated with @Nullable

	- Think about differnet groups of combinations of state under test and test at least one representative from each group

	- Identify and test boundary conditions
