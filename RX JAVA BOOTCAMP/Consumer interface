RxJava Consumer Interface : "A functional interface (callback) that accepts a single value"

In very simple terms, when we are using it,  RxJava Library  creates an Observer, passes our Consumer to it an it gets called in onNext 

Think about Consumer as a shortcut. We use RxJava Consumer Interface mainly for callbacks. 

The concept of callbacks is to inform a class ( synchronous  or asynchronous) if some work in another class is done.

Some call it the Hollywood principle: "Don't call us we call you"
